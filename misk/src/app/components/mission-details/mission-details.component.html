      <h1><span class="list-item-number">1</span> Verified Profiles</h1>
      <p>
        We like real people. We encourage all users to submit their name, education, profession,
        income and photos. We verify all this information to make sure you're building an honest
        relationship.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">2</span> Premium Filters</h1>
      <p>
        We let you filter by religion, profession, family plans, income and everything in between.
        Since it's verified information, you can rest assured you're getting exactly what you're
        looking for.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">3</span> Know Your Priorities</h1>
      <p>
        Whether it's religion or family plans, we know a person is more than just a bunch of
        categories. Thatâ€™s why we're the first app that allows you to input how important each
        category is to you, so you can find someone with similar priorities.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">4</span> Women Choose</h1>
      <p>
        We don't think harassment is very modern. When you get a match, it's up to the woman to
        start the conversation or give the man permission to make the first move.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">5</span> Zodiac Compatibility</h1>
      <p>
        We care what the stars have to say. You tell us your birthday, and we tell you if the stars
        align with everyone you meet.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">6</span> Likeable Content</h1>
      <p>
        We don't want you waiting for a match to know if someone's interested. You can like their
        content too, and we'll send them a notification that gives them the option to talk to you.
      </p>

    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">7</span> Know Who Likes You</h1>
      <p>
        We tell you who likes you before you've seen their profile. Because that's how your mother
        does it.

      <h1><span class="list-item-number">8</span> Hide Your Name</h1>
      <p>
        We know you might not be comfortable sharing your personal information with everyone. That's
        why we give you the option to hide your personal information like your age and last name.
