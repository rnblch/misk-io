      <h1><span class="list-item-number">1</span> Verified Profiles</h1>
      <p>
        We like real people. We encourage all users to submit their name, education, profession,
        income and photos. We verify all this information to make sure you're building an honest
        relationship.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">2</span> Premium Filters</h1>
      <p>
        We let you filter by religion, profession, family plans, income and everything in between.
        Since it's verified information, you can rest assured you're getting exactly what you're
        looking for.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">3</span> Priorities</h1>
      <p>
        Whether it's religion or family plans, we know a person is more than just a bunch of
        categories. Thatâ€™s why we're the first app that allows you to input how important each
        category is to you, so you can find someone with similar priorities.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">4</span> Hide Your Name</h1>
      <p>
        We know you might not be comfortable sharing your personal information with everyone. That's
        why we give you the option to hide personal information like your age and last name.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">5</span> Woman's Choice</h1>
      <p>
        We don't think harassment is very modern. When you get a match, it's up to the woman to
        start the conversation or give the man permission to make the first move.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">6</span> Zodiac Compatibility</h1>
      <p>
        We think astrology is fun. You tell us your birthday, and we tell you if the stars align
        with everyone you meet.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">7</span> Likeable Content</h1>
      <p>
        We don't want you waiting for a match to know if someone's interested. You can like their
        content too, and we'll send them a notification that gives them the chance to talk to you.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">8</span> Conversational Arabic</h1>
      <p>
        We think it's about time apps talked like people did. We use the kind of Arabic normal
        people speak every day, so you can feel at home.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">9</span> Baby Pictures</h1>
      <p>
        We think love is better when it's fun. That's why we let you generate a realistic baby photo
        based on a photo of you and your match at the touch of a finger.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">10</span> Who Liked You</h1>
      <p>
        We let you know if someone likes you even before you've seen their profile. Because that's
        what your mother does.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="glow dm700 section-text-shadow">
      <h1><span class="list-item-number">11</span> Secret Matches</h1>
      <p>
        We haven't forgetten about your mother. She loves to play matchmaker as much as we do. So we
        let family members anonymously insert profiles they like into your stack. But as always, the
        choice is yours.
