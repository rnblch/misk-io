        Misk wants you to know that we take the security of our applications and
        your private data very seriously. While it is impossible to anticipate

      <h2 class="dm600">Security Practices</h2>
      <p>
        Misk employs physical, procedural and electronic controls in connection
        with the protection of our systems and user data from unauthorized
        access. This includes regularly having our systems and applications
        reviewed for potential issues by our internal security team and outside
        security firms.

      <h2 class="dm600">Reporting Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p>
        Misk encourages input from the security research community to help
        improve the security of our applications and user data. We invite
        security researchers to responsibly disclose any potential
        vulnerabilities uncovered to
        <a class="dm600 link" href="mailto:info@miskme.com"
          >this email address</a
        >. We regularly monitor this address and will respond to submissions
        within 24-48h. If you do not receive a response within the timeframe, we
        ask that you resubmit your vulnerability report. For the safety of our
        users, we request that you please avoid sharing the information you have
        found about any potential vulnerabilities with anyone outside of Misk,
        until we have investigated and confirmed that such vulnerability has
        been properly addressed. You may use the PGP key below to encrypt your
        report.
